# Implementation Plan: Industrial Accident Pattern Analysis

## Goal
Identify recurring accident patterns using historical data to implement preventive measures.

## Data Source
- KOSHA Industrial Accident Statistics (2018-2023)

## Methodology
1. **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values and standardize text fields using Pandas.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyze distributions by time, type, and location.
3. **Visualization**: Create heatmaps and trend lines using Matplotlib/Seaborn.

## Key Findings
- High frequency of accidents on Monday mornings.
- Correlation between temperature extremes and accident rates.

## Action Plan
- Reinforce TBM on Mondays.
- Implement special safety protocols during heatwaves/cold waves.
